netflix-genre

I wrote this program to choose Netflix Movie Genre for us to watch.

To avoid fight which Genre to watch.

This program helps us to reduce the blast radius of our fight.

```shell
(⎈ |as_dev:monitoring) 33.netflix-genre ] ☘   sh get_movie_genre.sh
We will watch NetFlix Movie from Genre : Children & Family
We will watch NetFlix Movie from Genre : Thrillers
We will watch NetFlix Movie from Genre : Historical Movies
We will watch NetFlix Movie from Genre : Children & Family

```
